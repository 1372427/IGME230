# Darkness
## High Concept
If you let an enemy pass you, the world will get darker; maintain the light and kill the boss!

## Genres
This will be a side-scrolling shooter game. Meant to be mostly light-hearted, the art will be more chibi-style. The cholor scheme will be darker, with a base of black and red, to show the idea of "darkness taking over."

## Platform
The intention is for this to be universal. It will start as being for desktop and then will be made compatable for other devices.

## Story
### Origin
This game comes from an abstract version of fear or depression. Even if one becomes fearful or discouraged, they still need to achieve their goal, otherwise they will not progress and be stuck in life. Similarly, even if the screen becomes dark, until the player dies by enemy fire they have to continue trudging on. 

### Premise & Narrative
The kingdoms of plants and darkness have been neighbors since ancient times. Periodically, the every-hungry darkness will invade the kingdom of plants. Most plants wither in the face of darkness, so special machines have been built to battle against the Dark Army. However, very few of these machines remain. The player is one of the few who are able to pilot the machines and has to defeat the army and their leader to save the kingdom. Once the leader is defeated, the darkness will retreat. Will the player avoid the troops and allow darkness to descend first or will he defeat the troops and fight the leader in light?

## Esthetics
### Graphics
Graphics will be simple and more chibi-style. 

### Sound
There will be looped ambient sound. There will be different sounds for the score screen and actual play mode. When the player engages the boss, the music will change once again. Simple sound effects will also be used for shootng (both the player's and the enemy's).

## About the developer
My name is Rebecca Medina and I am a third-year Game Design and Development major with a minor in Japanese. I do not have much experience with games in particular as I transfered in this year (previously I was a Computer Science major). I know some Unity, Monogame and can work in Java, C#, C/C++, Python, as well as Matlab and R. I am particularly interested in learning more about graphic design (I also want to learn about making game physics!).
