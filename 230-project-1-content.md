# ***Darkness***
## High Concept
If you let an enemy pass you, the world will get darker; maintain the light and kill the boss!

## Genres
This will be a side-scrolling shooter game. Meant to be mostly light-hearted, the art will be more chibi or watercolor-style. 

## Platform
The intention is for this to be universal. It will start as being for desktop and then will be made compatible for other devices.

## Story
### Origin
This game comes from an abstract version of fear or depression. Even if one becomes fearful or discouraged, they still need to achieve their goal, otherwise they will not progress and be stuck in life. Similarly, even if the screen becomes dark, until the player dies by enemy fire they have to continue trudging on. 

### Premise & Narrative
The *Kingdom of Plants* and *Kingdom of Darkness* have been neighbors since ancient times. Periodically, the every-hungry darkness will invade the kingdom of plants. Most plants wither in the face of darkness, so special machines have been built to battle against the Dark Army. However, very few of these machines remain. The player is one of the few who are able to pilot the machines and has to defeat the army and their leader to save the kingdom. Once the leader is defeated, the darkness will retreat. Will the player avoid the troops and allow darkness to descend first or will he defeat the troops and fight the leader in light?

## Esthetics
### Graphics
Graphics will be simple and with more chibi proportions and watercolor-style coloring. The color scheme will be darker for the enemies, with a base of black and red, to show the idea of "darkness taking over." The main character will have a mostly green monochrome color scheme to show his plant background.

### Sound
There will be looped ambient sound. There will be different sounds for the score screen and actual play mode. When the player engages the boss, the music will change once again. Simple sound effects will also be used for shooting (both the player's and the enemy's).

## Gameplay
### Mechanics
The player can choose which strategy they would like to use: if they will try to kill all enemies, or if they will continue with limited visibility. 
There will also be periodic *bonus drops* which will include health boost, speed boost, shield boost, and attack boost. The player can only pick one type per drop, so they need to pick wisely. 

### Control
The controls will be different depending on what device is used. Desktop input will be from the keyboard, the accelerometer and touch will be inputs for phones, and tablets will use only touch input. A simple break down of these controls is as follows:

|             |Desktop    |Phone      |Tablet|
|:------------:|:----------:|:---------:|:----:|
|**Move Up**       |Arrow Up  |Tilt Up    |Swipe Up|
|**Move Down**     |Arrow Down|Tilt Down  |Swipe Down|
|**Move Left**     |Arrow Left|Tilt Left  |Swipe Left|
|**Move Right**    |Arrow Right|Tilt Right|Swipe Right|
|**Shoot**         |A          |Tap       |Tap|
|**Shield**        |D          |Hold      |Hold|
|**Speed Up**      |S          |Double Swipe|Double Swipe|
|**Pause/Unpause**|P           | Tap Button| Tap Button|

#### Notes
- The player will be limited in their mobility in the sense that they can only move within a certain area of the screen. 
- Shooting will be one-at-a-time, not continuous.
- The **shield** ability will have a limited time frame so it cannot constantly be used.
- The **speed** ability will be limited in time and power.
- There will be a button in the top right corner to pause/unpause the game for phone/tablet devices.


### Teaching the game
There will be separate instructional slides functioning as a tutorial to convey the rules and controls to the player.

### Player learning
The player must learn the movement and attack patterns of the enemies so that each time they play, they will get farther into the level. They will also need to be able to understand the number of enemies they are able to let pass them before they reach complete darkness.  

## Screenshots
I hope to have full-screen options for the games. I would like the game to appear as below:


*Note: There is a pause button at the top of the screen -this is for mobile versions.*


At the beginning of the game (no enemies passed the player):
![alt text][day]



After several enemies have passed the player:
![alt text][night]


Another option for how darkness descends is:
![alt text][night2]

[day]: https://people.rit.edu/rcm3517/230/project1/media/day.png "Daytime, everything is visible"
[night]: https://people.rit.edu/rcm3517/230/project1/media/night2.png "Darkened, visibility still ok"
[night2]: https://people.rit.edu/rcm3517/230/project1/media/night.png "Sunset, visibility still ok"


## Other
I am not too sure about what external libraries I will need.
I will be creating the art myself, but will likely try to find music and other assets online.


## About the developer
My name is Rebecca Medina and I am a third-year Game Design and Development major with a minor in Japanese. I do not have much experience with games in particular as I transferred in this year (previously I was a Computer Science major).

### Skills

I can work with Unity, Visual Studios, Eclipse, and Monogame.

I am familiar with Java, C#, C/C++, Python, Matlab and R programming languages.


### Interests
I am particularly interested in learning more about graphic design (I also want to learn about making game physics!).
